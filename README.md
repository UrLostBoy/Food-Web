# Food Web üçÆ

Our teacher asked us to make any kind of system using C language.<br>
So, me and my groupmates have come up with an idea to make an E-Canteen system for the school.<br>
With sufficient knowledge on C language and brainstorming we created our first project as a freshman.<br>
We call it "Food Web"
This repository is for the website that we also made for our system. <br>
For the source code for our system, <br>
my classmate John Lloyd made a separate repository for it on his Github account<br>
