# Food Web 🍮

Our teacher asked us to make any kind of system using C language.<br>
So, me and my groupmates have come up with an idea to make an E-Canteen system for the school.<br>
With sufficient knowledge on C language and brainstorming we created our first project as a freshman.<br>
We call it "Food Web"<br>
This repository is for the website that we also made for our system. <br>
For the source code of our system, <br>
my classmate John Lloyd made a separate repository on his Github account and you can download it<br>
The link is provided below: 👇 <br>

You can also download the powerpoint presentation that we presented to our teacher. 👇<br>

You can review our flowchart and the overview of the system in our ppt <br>
<br>
P.S. This is our first project.<br>
     And since we are still on our first year of college, <br>
     we still have a lot of time to improve.
     
     By the way please follow me and my classmate here on Github and thank you in advance. 🙇🏻<br>
     Only two of us in our group have Github accounts.<br>
